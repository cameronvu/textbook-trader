    "## In-depth guide to Textbook Trader:\n",
    "Textbook trader is an application that allows users to create and view textbook listings. The home page (index.html) provides a place for a previously registered user to log in; otherwise, there is an option to register. On the register page (register.html), users are prompted to enter their desired username, password, and other personal information that is stored in our ‘user’ SQL table. Following registration, the user is brought back to the login page and is prompted to login using their new username and password. A message is displayed following both a failed and successful login. If the username and password matches what is stored in the ‘user’ table in our SQL database, then the listing page (listing.html), which shows current textbook listings, is displayed. On this page, users may also create listings. If the user chooses to create a listing, then they are brought to the create page (create.html), where they submit information for their textbook listing, which is then stored in the ‘post’ table of our database. Following a successful textbook listing creation, the user is navigated back to the listing page where they can see their listing as well as remove the listing if they so desire. Another aspect of Textbook Trader includes the option for a user to edit their first name and or last name after their account creation by navigating to their account detail page on the website header."

    "For our project beta, we: \n",
    "1. merged out mock-up site (previously submitted as ---) into the program we constructed via the Flask tutorial\n",
    "2. edited both the 'user' and 'post' table of our SQL database to reflect the information about the user and the book listing that we wish to store\n",
    "3. constructed HTML pages for the account details page, the \n",
    "4. updated HTML pages using Jinja, the scripting language supported by Flask\n",
    "5. added fields for user registration including first name, last name, and email\n",
    "6. created an option for users to remove their own textbook listings (listings are not available to be removed if the logged-in user does not match the user that created the listing)\n",
    "7. added an update() method to auth.py which allows users to update their first name or last name (these updates are reflected in database and visually in the website header user greeting)"

    "## Goals for our final project:\n",
    "For our final project, we have goals of implementing a way to claim a textbook that is listed. Claiming a textbook, which would only be allowed if the user that claims the textbook is not the user that posted the listing, would remove the textbook from the listing and allow the lister and claimer to barter. Similarly, we plan to implement and address ant further feedback we receive in regards to this beta. "

    "## Computer language concepts used:\n",
    "For our beta, we have implemented concepts such as:\n",
    "1. A series of conditional statements are used in our Python files (specifically regarding get and post methods)\n",
    "3. HTML post and get methods in relation to our Python methods in files such as auth.py and listing.py which handle those requests\n",
    "4. Similarly, our Python methods (for example, create() and delete() in listing.py) handle changes that are reflected in our SQL databse\n",
    "5. Although Jinja is a different language than Python, the use of the scripting language in our HTML required us to apply computer language concepts which were already familiar to us and adapt those concepts to Jinja syntax (ex: Jinja uses a series of curly braces and %'s to denote conditionals; however, the statements if and else operate the same as in Python)\n",
    "6. The use of Python's None keyword in order to catch any errors. Conditional statements are based on the use of an error variable, which initially is set to the value None, and will only execute if the value of error is None.\n",
    "7. Our python methods end in return statements, many of which redirect the user to another page. This allows our HTML submit fields to execute accordingly (ex: in the register() method of auth.py, if the method of the input field is post, which means that the user is attempting to register, then the method executes and returns a redirect to the login page so the newly registered user can log in)\n",
    "8. Our return statements also return pages that display objects, which are handled by iteration in Jinja in our HTML pages (ex: listings are displayed on the page by iterating through the post objects and displaying the information held in the post table of our database)\n",
    "9. The importation of a series of modules into our Python files for use including sys, functools, a series of imports specific to the Flask framework, and our own files.\n",
    "10. The use of Python as an object oriented language (ex: in auth.py we create a Blueprint object, specific to Flask, which we call methods upon using object oriented syntax like bp.route() which handles how we navigate through HTML pages)"
